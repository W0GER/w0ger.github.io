## About This Site

In today's development world, we are really building on the shoulders of giants!

* The [Jekyll][jekyll link] markdown blogging platform (which is run on [Ruby][ruby link])
* The [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap link] gem
* The [Minimal Mistakes theme][minimal mistakes link] (which I tweaked a bit).
* All of this is hosted (for free!) On [Github pages][github-pages link], because they're awesome.
* Comments are done via [Giscus][giscus link], so they're hosted via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/seankilleen.github.io/discussions).
