Hey tech enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into a common yet often overlooked
puzzle in the world of feature proposals and pull requests: the slippery nature
of time references. Words like "currently" and "now" can sometimes create more
confusion than clarity, so let's break it down!

Imagine you're reviewing a pull request, and amidst the code chatter, someone
asks, "If the file is missing, what happens?" The response might be, "Currently,
it crashes if the file is missing." Sounds straightforward, right? Well, not
quite. Is "currently" referring to the state before the changes or the state if
you build with the proposed changes? This ambiguity can sneak up on anyone.

Similarly, in feature proposals, when we say, "There will be a method for
reversing the polarity of the neutron flow," what do we mean by "will"? If "now"
refers to the system's state sans this feature, then "will" points to the future
where this feature is implemented. But if our "now" is post-initial
implementation, then "will" hints at future enhancements.

And let's not forget our branches! If you hear, "currently in the
implementation," it might mean there's a bug in the branch that crashes the
system. Thatâ€™s the current scenario, but with plans to resolve it soon.

The key takeaway? Be precise! When you're drafting or reviewing documents, take
an extra moment to clarify your temporal references. It helps avoid
misunderstandings and keeps everyone on the same page. Happy coding! ðŸ¤“

Remember, clear communication is the backbone of successful collaboration.
Keep those lines clear and watch your projects soar!
