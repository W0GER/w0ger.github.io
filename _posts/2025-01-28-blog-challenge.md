I know some people hate this kind of meta post, but I really like them. I find
it fascinating learning how other people who manage their site and workflow.
Mainly to see if there's something I can steal, er um, borrow.

So anyway, I've adapted [the original questions from Ava](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/)
to be more generic.

The questions are:

1. Why did you start blogging in the first place?
1. What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?
1. Have you blogged on other platforms before?
1. How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a
panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?
1. When do you feel most inspired to write?
1. Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a
draft?
1. What's your favorite post on your blog?
1. Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform,
or adding a new feature?

So without further ado, here's my answers to the questions...

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

This is my second attempt at blogging. The first was years ago, back when
Blogger was all the rage. That blog has long since disappeared, replaced
by the convenience of other platforms. My reason for starting back then was
simple: I wanted a small corner of the internet to share my thoughts. The same
holds true today. With all the algorithms, ads, and tracking dominating the
online world, having a space I can call my own and fully control feels more
important than ever.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

Check out my [About](/about) page to see the technology stack that I'm using.
The GitHub Pages is fairly light weight and I use `git` in my day-to-day work.
A lot of inspiration was taken from fellow blogger [Sean Killeen](https://seankilleen.com)
and he was using the same open source tools; making it easy for to to learn.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Yes, I had an account on [Blogger.com](https://blogger.com) many years ago.
I also do some micro-blogging on [Mastodon](https://woof.group/@w0ger) and
[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/rogernoden.com).

## How do you write your posts?

When I come across a topic that I feel I should write about, if I'm away from
the computer I'll send myself a quick email from my mobile. Once I'm at my
computer, those thoughts are transferred to GitHub Issues. From there I flush
out my thoughts, do additional research, etc. Then when I feel there is enough
content, I transfer it to a post in the code repo.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Sometimes I find it very difficult to get inspired to write, but with where the
current US political landscape is going, I feel that I need to have a place
for my voice to be heard.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

It depends on the content, if it's a simple topic I usually publish immediately.
If it's more complex or nuanced, I will let it sit for awhile and review it
multiple times before hitting the publish button.

## What's your favorite post on your blog?

Since I've just started blogging again, this would probably be my favorite
post at this point.

## Any future plans for your blog?

The plans for now is to launch this blog and continue writing.
The layout was recently created, so no need to do any updates.
