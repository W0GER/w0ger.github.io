I created this page because I receive a lot of contacts from those recruiting
for a position.
It is meant to complement [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogernoden/).

Do you want to know if I'd be a good fit for your organization,
or would you like to work together?
Read on below to see if we should chat!

## My Current Status

I am passively open to new opportunities as a way of keeping an open mind.
If you think you have a great fit, feel free to send it my way.

## Are We a Good Match?

### Types of Work

I'm likely a fit for the following types of roles or similar:

* **Technical Leadership:**
Rallying a team or organization toward an objective
and moving things forward is something that's in my veins.
Depending on the organization, this may be a CTO, Vice-President, Director,
Fellow, Principal, or Technical Manager role (or similar).
I am at my best when I'm providing a large impact across teams or an
organization and empowering / enabling teams to achieve that impact.

* **Developer Relations:**
I love forming relationships and teaching about technology and development
approaches.

* **Internal / productivity engineering:**
I delight in being a force multiplier and enabling my colleagues to do their
best.
Tooling, CI/CD pipelines and systems, removing blockers, etc. I'd probably do
best when combining this with some sort of technical leadership capacity,
as I believe everyone should be invested in these things.

### I'm potentially a great fit if...

(You don't have to check all of these boxes, especially if you'd like me to
help move you to that place.)

* :heavy_check_mark: **The position is full-time**. I'm looking to find a place
I can grow with and make a substantial impact.
* :heavy_check_mark: **You work in the Microsoft / .NET space**. I'm comfortable
in other arenas but am currently most invested in that ecosystem.
* :heavy_check_mark: **The position is remote**, particularly if the
organization is remote-first.
I don't mind being in person, but COVID-19 adjusted my priorities.
* :heavy_check_mark: **Your organization is looking to embrace agility.**
* :heavy_check_mark: **You want smaller feedback loops.** I like to move
organizations toward streams of value, working iteratively and incrementally to
produce it.
* :heavy_check_mark: **Culture is on the table.** I believe people who work at
an organization have (and should have) a hand in shaping culture.
* :heavy_check_mark: **I can create content around my work.** I tend to create
content -- tweets, blog posts, demos -- around the work I'm doing.
It doesn't have to be part of the day to day, but sharing with the world is
very important to me, so it at least shouldn't be frowned upon.
(I'd never reveal anything in confidence, etc. of course.)
* :heavy_check_mark: **You're at least cloud-curious.** The cloud offers a great
deal of potential for organizations. If you're not currently using it, it would
be great if you're at least open to considering the value it can provide.
* :heavy_check_mark: **Your organization has policies that treat staff as
humans.**
Flexible / Unlimited / Mandatory PTO, unlimited sick time, an environment of
freedom/trust, etc. are some examples.
* :heavy_check_mark: **You don't want me to stay "in a lane".** I am someone who
loves "honey-combing" to provide value across an organization.
* :heavy_check_mark: **You want ideas for improvement.** I have been described
as an "idea-dense" person.
They're not all going to be gold, but receptive organizations will benefit the
most from me.
* :heavy_check_mark: **You believe that technology delivery is a team sport.**
* :heavy_check_mark: **You care about a culture which very much includes
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging.**
I have no desire to reinforce harmful status quo or toxic systems of inequality.

### I'm potentially not a great fit if...

(It's OK if you check some of these boxes, especially if you want my help in
fixing them.)

* :x: **The position is contract / temporary.** I'm only seeking full-time roles
where I can invest effort and make an impact.
* :x: **The work is in consulting.** I have a background in great consulting
impact, but I want to bring my full potential and impact to bear on the
mission of an organization.
* :x: **I will be stuck using less-than-ideal equipment, especially if I can't
bring my own.**
While not a game-changer, this usually signals a lack of investment in
engineering culture, as the time loss of underpowered hardware vastly outweighs
the cost savings.
* :x: **You work with non-civilian government or health insurance.**
I want to ensure my personal ethics remain aligned with my work.
* :x: **You are looking for a super-senior individual contributor.** While I
have the technical skills and can certainly do this as needed, I prefer working
with and leveling up teams.
Technology delivery is a team sport.
* :x: **You are located more than 30 minutes from Minneapolis, MN (if not remote).**
I am a Husband and I'd like to spend more of my time at home instead of
commuting.
* :x: **You don't want to move things forward.** I am continually seeking to
move approaches, technology, and organizational culture forward.
It's how I'm programmed.
I'm a realist -- these things don't happen overnight, and I don't have some
grand perfect vision -- but if your organization isn't interested in that,
it's probably not a great fit.
* :x: **You 'do Agile' or think there's one way to be agile.**
Agility takes many forms and is a continual pursuit.

## Feedback I've Received

Highlights from what my peers recently said about me, anonymously.
I am incredibly proud of this feedback, and feel it represents what I can bring
to an organization.

### Feedback

> "Roger’s can do attitude is justified by his deep technical skill set.
  He has led multiple teams in to understand a core IT problem, identify the
  solving architecture or product, and own the implementation.
  This ability to select the correct solution and own the implementation is only
  possible because understanding the current IT product and technology landscape
  is a driven passion for him.
  I would not hesitate to recommend him for a large project manager or CTO
  position, and his enthusiasm for fully understanding his subject and managing
  teams and groups allows him to excel in a wide range of strategic roles."

> "Roger’s commitment to improving processes and removing roadblocks to the
  efficient delivery of high-quality solutions were key to helping the
  Development and Product teams achieve their goals of
  delivering multiple solutions, all while continuing to make progress on the
  Next Generation Content system.
  His willingness to take ownership for shared resources (e.g. build systems)
  and effectively coordinate activity across multiple stakeholders served to
  keep the teams focused on their core job of producing software, without
  getting bogged down in distracting impediments.
  The team delivered close to 50% more feature content in 2020 than 2019,
  with no additional headcount, and Roger’s direct help and leadership
  contributed greatly to that achievement."

> "Roger also proved instrumental in taking a practical approach to leading the
  Diversity and Inclusion task force. While Roger is only just beginning this
  journey leading the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and initiatives here at
  Outsell, we are thankful for his leadership and look forward to what is to
  come!"

> "Roger is a true leader. He coaches, asks questions (doesn’t give commands),
  and gives credit to others. He uses his past experience to implement well
  thought out solutions as a team effort.
  Working with him has been a tremendous learning experience.
  I look forward to any project I get to work with Roger on."

> "Roger is probably the best supervisor I have had in my professional career.
  He has a great eye for talent and assembled a top notch team at Mercury
  Companies.
  He was always able to provide guidance when needed, but also knew how to let
  his staff take an idea and run with it so they could call it their own and be
  highly invested and passionate about it.
  I have always strived in the years since then to lead teams I was responsible
  for in the same manner."

> "Roger is an incredibly effective manager and a wonderful person to work
  around.
  He would plug into any environment tremendously well due to his adaptability.
  His attention to detail and communication skills really set him apart from the
  rest of the pack."

> "Roger did an amazing job on the [project name] database and user access
  management collaborating with both product and other development teams.
  Additionally, Roger stepped up and took on the Scrum Master role for the
  [team name] Team and continued to manage blockers and impediments very well."
